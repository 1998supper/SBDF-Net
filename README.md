Inspired by U-Net, we propose a dual-branch encoder for aggregating multi-scale context information. A novelty Shuffle Grouped Fusion Module is used to fuse cross-scale information between dual branches. In addition, Skip Connection+ calibrates the features extracted by encoder to optimize the feature mapping. Finally, Three-branch Down-sampling Block and Two-branch Up-sampling Block are designed to reduce the feature loss produced by sampling operations. We have evaluated the performance of our network on four datasets.
